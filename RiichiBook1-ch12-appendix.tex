\noindent If you are a complete beginner, I recommend:

\index{Barr@Barr, Jenn}

\bigskip
\noindent There are a few English books on WWYD (What would you discard) problems. Working on WWYD problems would be a good next step after finishing my book.

Of these four books, I recommend the last one, written and edited by three Western professional players with the Japan Professional Mahjong League. The book contains WWYD problems and discussions as well as quizzes about tile efficiency, waits, and score calculation. 

\bigskip
Their WWYD discussions are a lot more multidimensional compared with stylized hand examples introduced in my book. You would find it interesting to see how Jenn and Garthe often disagree about what they would discard. Even those players who share a similar view on strategy principles can still disagree about exactly how to apply these principles in a given situation. 
You would be able to understand their WWYD discussions much better \emph{after} completing my book first.

Scott D. Miller, a riichi player from Texas, has recently published two books on the history, culture, rules, and variants of riichi mahjong. I have not had a chance to read them, but both of them seem to be a fun reading.

Osamuko is one of the most extensive online mahjong blogs in English. There are quite a few blog entries there, and many of them are very good. In particular, I find the articles by a contributor named UmaiKeiki very useful.

There is a Facebook group page hosted by one of the contributors of Osamuko. It is a closed group, but I suppose anyone can join the group by sending a request to the administrator. Group members frequently post their play records from {\jap Tenhou} and ask for other members' opinions on them.
